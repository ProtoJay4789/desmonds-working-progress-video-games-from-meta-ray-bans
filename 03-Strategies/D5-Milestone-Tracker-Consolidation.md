## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Live Config** | Reads `.lfj-aae-config.json` (no more hardcoded $83.92 bugs) |
| **CMC Watchlist** | 7-coin portfolio (BTC, SOL, LINK, AVAX, TAO, XAUt, BEAM) |
| **LP Position** | Range, fee efficiency, P&L, impermanent loss |
| **Milestone Ladder** | Scout → Raider → Warlord → Sovereign → Freedom tiers |
| **5-min Escalation** | Breakout warning → red alert if still out after 5 min |
| **Edge Detection** | ≤30% efficiency = urgent rebalance recommendation |
| **Smart DCA** | 4 zones: Center (≥70% → $50) / Mid (50–70% → $30) / Low (30–50% → $20) / Edge (<30% → $10) |
| **Compound Alerts** | Notifies when cumulative fees hit thresholds |
| **Monday DCA** | Auto-reminder with efficiency-based amount |

## 🔧 How It Works

### Alert Logic

```
SILENT if:
  - Within range AND efficiency > 50% AND
  - No CMC moves ≥3% AND
  - Not Monday AND
  - No compound ready

ALERT if ANY:
  - CMC move ≥3%
  - Out of range
  - Efficiency ≤ 50%
  - Compound ready (> $50 cumulative)
  - Monday (DCA day)
  - Efficiency ≤ 30% (edge rebalance zone)
```

### Breakout Escalation

```
t+0 min  → Price crosses range bound → LIGHT WARNING ⚠️
t+5 min  → Still out of range? → RED ALERT 🔴
t+∞      → Back in range → RESET (all clear ✅)
```

### DCA by Zone (Curve shape)

```
Efficiency ≥70%  → Center zone  → $50 (full steam)
Efficiency 50–70% → Mid zone    → $30 (steady)
Efficiency 30–50% → Low zone    → $20 (edge watch)
Efficiency <30%   → Edge/crash  → $10 + URGENT rebalance
```

## ✅ Transition Checklist (post-approval)

**Performed by Desmond (Creative):**
- [ ] Document script feature set in vault (this doc)
- [ ] Update `03-Strategies/cron-jobs.md` manifest with new job details
- [ ] Archive old scripts with clear deprecation notices
- [ ] Announce in Strategies group (new D5 Tracker live)

**Performed by YoYo (Ops):**
- [ ] Create Hermes cron job: `D5 Milestone Tracker` → 08:15, 12:15, 16:15, 20:15 ET
- [ ] Remove jobs: `1f10f10b2a07`, `915b1df66348`, `862ae0c1f85d`
- [ ] Confirm: is `8ae8a04f3b71` (LP Position Monitor) kept or retired?
- [ ] Verify first run produces output, no errors

**Performed by DMOB (Code):**
- [ ] Review script logic (optional if code is straightforward)
- [ ] Confirm config loading from `.lfj-aae-config.json`
- [ ] Validate 30% edge threshold + DCA zones match Jordan spec
- [ ] Sign off on exit codes/ALERT prefixes

## 📋 Open Questions

1. **Should we keep the 10-min LP Position Monitor (`8ae8a04f3b71`) as fallback?** If D5 tracker runs 4×/day, 10-min may be overkill. Jordan's rule: no duplication.
2. **Bid-ask spread integration:** Not yet implemented (would require order book API). If needed, add to "TODO" section.
3. **State migration:** Old state files (`.lfj-range-state.json`) remain for backward compatibility; new state is `.d5-milestone-state.json`. Can we clean up old state after 30 days?
