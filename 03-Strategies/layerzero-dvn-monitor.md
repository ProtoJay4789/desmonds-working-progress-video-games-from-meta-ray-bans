     2|
     3|## 2026-04-23
     4|- **Key Findings**: 
     5|    - LayerZero Labs published a detailed "KelpDAO Incident Statement" (April 19, 2026) regarding a ~$290M exploit.
     6|    - The attack was an RPC-spoofing and DDoS attack likely by Lazarus Group (TraderTraitor), targeting the LayerZero Labs DVN's downstream RPC infrastructure.
     7|    - The vulnerability was realized only because KelpDAO used a **1-of-1 DVN configuration** (LayerZero Labs as sole verifier), contradicting the protocol's recommended multi-DVN redundancy model.
     8|    - LayerZero Labs has deprecated affected RPC nodes, replaced them, and is now actively reaching out to all 1/1 configurations to migrate to multi-DVN setups.
     9|    - No protocol-level "mandatory" DVN changes were announced, but the "Integrations Checklist" is being heavily emphasized as the standard.
    10|    10|- **Risk Level**: Unchanged (The protocol itself remains modular; the risk is shifted to application-level configuration).
    11|    11|- **Action Items**: 
    12|    12|    - Verify all Gentech-linked integrations are NOT using 1/1 DVN configurations.
    13|    13|    - Audit DVN diversity (ensure no single provider is a systemic dependency).
    14|    14|    - Monitor for any formal "security standard" mandates that might emerge from the community or Labs.

    18|    18|
    19|    19|**Date Checked:** 2026-04-24
    20|    20|**Risk Level:** Unchanged (High for 1/1 configs, Low for multi-DVN)
    21|    21|
    22|    22|## Key Findings
    23|    23|- **Incident Status:** The KelpDAO exploit ($290M) was confirmed to be an RPC-spoofing attack targeting the LayerZero Labs DVN, likely by Lazarus Group (TraderTraitor).
    24|    24|- **Root Cause:** Attackers poisoned downstream RPC infrastructure and used DDoS to force failover to malicious nodes.
    25|    25|- **Protocol Response:** LayerZero Labs has deprecated the affected RPC nodes and resumed DVN operations. They maintain that the protocol itself was not exploited, but rather the infrastructure upon which the DVN relied.
    26|    26|- **Security Standards:** LayerZero is actively urging all applications with 1/1 DVN configurations to migrate to multi-DVN setups. They reiterate that no single DVN should be a unilateral point of trust.
    27|    27|- **Contagion:** LayerZero claims zero contagion to other assets/applications, as the exploit specifically targeted KelpDAO's rsETH 1/1 configuration.
    28|    28|- **Industry Context:** This highlights a fundamental risk in off-chain RPC verification shared by many bridges and services.
    29|    29|
    30|    30|## Action Items
    31|    31|- [ ] Monitor LayerZero's official channels for any mandatory DVN configuration updates or new minimum security standards.
    32|    32|- [ ] Verify if any Gentech-related integrations are using 1/1 DVN setups; if so, migrate to multi-DVN immediately.
    32|    33|- [ ] Track any competitive responses from Wormhole/Axelar regarding their own RPC dependency risks.

    35|    36|**Date Checked:** 2026-04-25
    36|    37|**Risk Level:** Unchanged (High for 1/1 configs, Low for multi-DVN)
    37|    38|
    38|    39|## Key Findings
    39|    40|- **Incident Status:** No new protocol-level security updates or mandatory DVN changes published since the April 19 KelpDAO Incident Statement.
    40|    41|- **Official Blog Snapshot (layerzero.network/blog):**
    41|    42|  1. **KelpDAO Incident Statement** (Apr 19) — Still pinned/prominent. Reiterates Lazarus/TraderTraitor attribution, RPC-spoofing via downstream node poisoning, zero contagion, and active outreach to 1/1 DVN integrators. Labs DVN is live after deprecating affected RPC nodes.
    42|    43|  2. **Worldpay “Payments DVN” Launch** — New announcement (post-incident). Worldpay/Global Payments is now offering an enterprise-grade Payments DVN across 9+ blockchains. This signals continued institutional trust in the DVN model rather than a retreat.
    43|    44|  3. **Canton & Centrifuge Partnerships** — LayerZero continues institutional onboarding (Canton Network for institutional finance; Centrifuge tokenization infrastructure). No mention of security overhauls tied to these launches.
    44|    45|  4. **Zero Blockchain Announcements** — Several posts on “Zero: The Decentralized Multi-Core World Computer.” Unrelated to immediate DVN security but indicates engineering bandwidth is on the new chain, not an emergency protocol patch.
    45|    46|- **Protocol Position:** LayerZero maintains the protocol functioned as intended and continues to treat multi-DVN redundancy as a *recommendation*, not a protocol-enforced mandate. No new governance proposals or minimum security standards (e.g., requiring ≥2 DVNs at the protocol level) were detected.
    46|    47|- **Dune Dashboard:** Unable to verify live DVN distribution stats today due to Cloudflare bot detection on dune.com. Based on prior reports (Apr 23-24), the ~47% 1-of-1, ~45% 2-of-2, ~5% 3-of-3+ distribution is assumed stable until next successful poll.
    47|    48|- **Competitor / Market Response:** No widely publicized competitive capitalizing statements from Wormhole, Axelar, or Hyperlane detected via open-source sweep today. Bing/X searches did not surface any new competitor blog posts or governance actions referencing the KelpDAO incident to poach integrators.
    48|    49|- **KelpDAO / Blame Narrative:** CoinDesk article “Kelp DAO hits back at LayerZero” (Apr 20) was referenced in search results, indicating KelpDAO disputes the blame-shift narrative, but no new public rebuttals from either side surfaced today.
    49|    50|
    50|    51|## Action Items
    51|    52|- [ ] Verify all Gentech-linked integrations are NOT using 1/1 DVN configurations; prioritize migration to ≥2 independent DVNs.
    52|    53|- [ ] Continue polling Dune dashboard directly or via screenshot/vision tool once bot-detection workaround is available to confirm if 1-of-1 DVN share is declining post-incident.
    53|    54|- [ ] Monitor LayerZero governance channels (Snapshot, forum) for any formal proposals to enforce minimum DVN thresholds at the protocol level.
    54|    55|- [ ] Track competitor messaging (Wormhole, Axelar, Hyperlane) for opportunistic “security-first” campaigns targeting current LayerZero integrators.

# LayerZero DVN Security Monitor Report - 2026-04-27

**Date Checked:** 2026-04-27
**Risk Level:** Unchanged (High for 1/1 configs, Low for multi-DVN)

## Key Findings
- **New Security Advisories / CVEs:** None detected. GitHub Security Advisories page is empty. NVD search yields no LayerZero-specific CVEs. No emergency patches or new releases on the LayerZero-v2 repo since prior check.
- **Official Blog Status (layerzero.network/blog):** Most recent posts remain the KelpDAO Incident Statement (Apr 19), Worldpay Payments DVN launch (Mar 31), and institutional partnership announcements (Canton, Centrifuge, KorDA). No new security updates in the past 7 days.
- **Protocol Configuration Changes:** LayerZero has not published any protocol-level mandatory DVN configuration changes. Multi-DVN redundancy remains a recommendation, not an on-chain enforcement. No new governance proposals (Snapshot/forum) detected.
- **Exploit / Disclosure Status:** No new critical exploits disclosed since the KelpDAO incident. Post-incident media coverage continues (e.g., “Ripple CTO Flags Bridge Security Gaps,” “~47% of OApps still use 1-of-1 DVN”). These are retrospective analyses, not new breaches.
- **DVN Infrastructure / Validator Updates:** No new validator set rotations or DVN operator announcements detected. Worldpay’s Payments DVN (enterprise-grade, 9+ chains) is still the most recent major DVN entrant.

## Action Items
- [ ] Continue verifying Gentech-linked integrations are not on 1/1 DVN configs.
- [ ] Track if LayerZero makes multi-DVN mandatory at the protocol level.
- [ ] Re-poll Dune dashboard once access is restored to confirm 1/1 DVN share trend.
