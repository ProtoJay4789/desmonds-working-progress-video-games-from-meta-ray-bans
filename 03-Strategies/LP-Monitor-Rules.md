# LP + Milestone Tracker Rules — AVAX/USDC (AAE v2)

> Established: 2026-04-18
> Updated: 2026-04-27 — Range rebalanced to 9.00–9.30 (bid-ask), tiered alert system
> Status: Active
> Pool: LFJ V2.2 AVAX/USDC (binStep 10, pool 0x864d4e5ee7318e97483db7eb0912e09f161516ea)

## Current Position

- **Range:** $9.00 — $9.30 (rebalanced Apr 27 — bid-ask shape)
- **Position:** ~$83.37 (3.33 AVAX + $51.91 USDC)
- **Shape:** Bid-Ask
- **Strategy:** Bear market accumulation — farm the bottom, compound rewards
- **Crash Scenario (Dadrian):** If AVAX drops to $8.30-9.00, DCA strategy will work itself out through Impermanent Loss (IL). Continuous DCA at lower prices builds cheaper positions—IL math naturally offsets price decay over time.
- **Optimal Entry Range:** During crash, consider 70 USDC / 30 AVAX bid-ask weighting (Curve-style concentrated liquidity).
- **Current Tool:** Using Curve shape while moving slowly (low volatility)

### Signal Severity Levels

| Level | Condition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **SILENT** | In range + efficiency ≥ 50% + no compound/DCA/milestone | Log only, no Telegram |
| **OK** | Compound ready OR DCA day OR milestone hit | Telegram notification |
| **ALERT** | Out of range OR efficiency < 50% | Telegram alert + suggest rebalance |
| **CRITICAL** | Efficiency < 30% or price crash | Immediate alert + urgent rebalance |

---

## Monitoring Rules (Jordan's Exact Spec)

### Rule 1 — Check Frequency
⏰ LP Monitor runs **4×/day** (8:25 AM, 12:25 PM, 4:25 PM, 8:25 PM ET) via consolidated cron job `44f7c2028766`.

### Rule 2 — In Range + High Efficiency → SILENT
🤫 Price in range AND fee efficiency **50–100%** → **no alert, stay silent** (compact log only)

### Rule 3 — In Range + Low Efficiency → ALERT
⚠️ Price in range BUT fee efficiency **< 50%** → alert: *"fee efficiency dropping — consider rebalancing"*

### Rule 4 — Out of Range → ALERT
⚠️ Price out of range → **immediate alert** (v2: no 5-min delay, structured signal handles confirmation)

### Rule 5 — Overnight Pause
🌙 **Pause at 11 PM**, resume at **6:30 AM** (EDT/EST)

### Rule 6 — Recovery Alert
🔔 When price returns to range after being out → alert with "recovered"

## Squad Progression Tiers (Updated Apr 25)

| Tier | Rank | Daily Fee Target | Visual | Unlocks |
|------|------|-----------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Scout** | $5/day | Bronze badge | Entry strategies (CURVE) |
| 2 | **Raider** | $20/day | Silver badge | SPOT + BIDIRECTIONAL shapes |
| 3 | **Warlord** | $55/day | Gold badge | Multi-pool positions |
| 4 | **Sovereign** | $200/day | Platinum badge | Custom strategy creation |

### Progress Calculation
```
progress_pct = ((current_daily_fees - current_tier_target) / (next_tier_target - current_tier_target)) * 100
```

### Rule P1 — Tier Promotion
🏆 When estimated daily fees cross a tier threshold → ALERT with promotion + new unlocks

### Rule P2 — Progress Updates
📊 Every OK/ALERT includes current rank, next rank, and % progress

---

## Compound Tracker Rules

### Rule C1 — Compound Ready
🔄 When cumulative fees hit **$50 threshold** → ALERT: "Compound ready — reinvest + DCA"

### Rule C2 — DCA Day Reminder
💰 **Monday** → Alert: "$50 DCA ready to deploy"

### Rule C2b — Efficiency-Triggered Micro-DCA (NEW)
📉 When fee efficiency drops, deploy **bonus DCA** in $10–$20 increments:

| Efficiency | Trigger | Bonus DCA | Action |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **60–50%** | Yellow flag | $0 | Watch only — still earning, no panic |
| **50–40%** | Orange flag | **$10** | Price near edge, deploy micro-DCA + monitor for rebalance |
| **40–30%** | Red flag | **$20** | Strongly consider rebalancing range + DCA into fresh range |
| **<30%** | Critical | **$20 + rebalance** | Shift range immediately, deploy DCA into new position |

**Principle:** Never DCA into a stale range without at least *considering* a rebalance. Bonus DCA is for fresh, efficient positions only.

### Rule C3 — Compound Report
📊 Every alert includes:
- Est. daily fees (from pool volume × position share)
- Cumulative fees earned
- Days in range
- Current tier + progress %
- DCA countdown
- Compound threshold progress

---

## Fee Efficiency Formula

### Curve Shape (Default)
```
position = (price - RANGE_LOW) / (RANGE_HIGH - RANGE_LOW)
fee_efficiency = (1 - abs(position - 0.5) * 2) * 100
```
- **Center (50%)** → 100% efficiency
- **Edge (0% or 100%)** → 0% efficiency

### Spot Shape
- **In range** → 100% efficiency (uniform)
- **Out of range** → 0% efficiency

### Bidirectional Shape
- **Edges** → 100% efficiency (highest at extremes)
- **Center** → 0% efficiency

## Data Sources

| Priority | Source | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Birdeye x402** | Premium data, requires API key |
| 2 | **DexScreener** | Free, no key, reliable |
| 3 | **On-chain RPC** | Fallback, no volume data |

---

## Fee Estimation Formula

```
daily_fees = pool_volume_24h × (fee_tier_bps / 10000) × (position_usd / pool_liquidity)
apr = (daily_fees × 365 / position_usd) × 100
```

## Compound Strategy (Jordan's Vision)

**"Bear market accumulation play — farm the bottom, compound rewards"**

- LP generates fees in the $9.33-$9.52 range
- Compound weekly: reinvest accumulated fees + $50-100 DCA
- Target: $5/day (Scout) → $20/day (Raider) by July → $55/day (Warlord) by Sep 2027
- Each compound increases position → more fees → faster tier progression

### Crash / Out-of-Range Decision Matrix (Dadrian Logic)

> *"How am I doing vs stakers/hodlers? Should I hold?"*

| Scenario | Position Value | Loss from Current | Mechanics | Decision Logic |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **In Range (9.33–9.52)** | ~$83.92 | — | Earning fees | ✅ **HOLD** — keep LP, compound fees |
| **Below Range ($8.80)** | ~$78.63 | -$5.29 | 100% AVAX | ❓ **HOLD vs DCA?** — if AVAX fundamentals intact, **add USDC** |
| **Crash ($8.30)** | ~$74.17 | -$9.75 | 100% AVAX | ⚠️ **DCA or EXIT?** — if deep dump, **70 USDC / 30 AVAX** weighted re-entry |
| **Staking comparison** | — | — | 13.5% APR vs 5138% LP APR | ✅ **LP wins** — fees dominate staking unless extreme volatility |

**Key insight:** Once below range, **you're just holding AVAX**. No IL — just price depreciation. Same as if you'd never LP'd.

**DCA Re-entry Play:**
- Add $50 USDC at ~$8.50 → buy ~5.88 AVAX
- Total AVAX: ~14.82
- Set new range: $8.30–$9.00 (or $8.30–$9.10)
- Recovery to $9.00: position ≈ **$133**
- Earning fees the entire way up

### Shape Selection by Regime

| Condition | Recommended Shape | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Slow grind / chop (now)** | **Curve** | Captures small moves both directions, smooth efficiency curve |
| **Crash / panic dump** | **70 USDC / 30 AVAX (skewed)** | Buying the dip, not market-making; avoids center loss |
| **Bidirectional (wide range)** | **Spot + Curved Ends** | High upside at extremes, low cost in middle |
| **Trending up hard** | **Spot (100% AVAX) or EXIT** | No need to market make — just hold asset |

---

## Bid-Ask DCA Weighting (Crash Protection)

When price is **out of range** and **fee efficiency < 30%**, deploy DCA with **weighted asset allocation** to minimize IL:

| Efficiency | DCA Type | USDC Weight | AVAX Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **60–50%** | Normal DCA | 50% | 50% | Standard rebalancing |
| **50–40%** | Weighted DCA | **70%** | **30%** | Price near lower edge, bias to USDC |
| **40–30%** | Recovery DCA | **80%** | **20%** | Strong bias to USDC, expecting re-entry |
| **<30%** | Aggressive Recovery | **90%** | **10%** | Deep dump — buy AVAX dip, minimize IL risk |

**Principle:** Never DCA into a stale range without at least *considering* a rebalance. Bonus DCA is for fresh, efficient positions only.

## Fee Efficiency vs Staking Performance

| APY | staking (GEN/AVAX) | LP (LFJ V2.2) | LP Advantage |
|-----|--------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Base** | 13.5% APR | 5138% APR | **+5124.5%** |
| **Daily Fees (S1)** | $0.22 | $0.33 | **+0.11** |
| **Risk** | Low (no impermanent loss) | Medium (IL only if out-of-range) | LP wins on risk-adjusted return |
| **Volatility Hedge** | None | In-range fees offset price decay | LP outperforms in sideways/crash |

**Bottom line:** LP APR is **38x higher** than staking. The only scenario where staking wins is during **extreme volatility** (>20% daily moves where IL > fees earned).

### Compound Checklist
1. ✅ LP in range, earning fees
2. ⬜ Accumulate $50+ in fees
3. ⬜ It's Monday (DCA day)
4. ⬜ Withdraw fees → swap to AVAX+USDC → re-deposit to LP
5. ⬜ Add $50-100 fresh capital (DCA)
6. ⬜ Log compound event in state file

- Compact P&L block (Est. Daily Fees, Cumulative Fees, LP Value vs HODL)
- Inline pool context (Vol 24h, TVL)
- Squad-aware tier progression (Scout → Raider → Warlord → Sovereign)

## ✅ D5 Milestone Summary Consolidated — Apr 26 2026

Jordan's directive: Consolidate the daily LP summary into the D5 milestone format.

**What changed:**
- daily-lp-summary.py → replaced by d5-milestone-summary.py
- Daily 8 AM cron now produces structured D5 Milestone Report:
  - Full tier ladder display (Scout→Raider→Warlord→Sovereign) with progress bars
  - Micro-DCA triggers with efficiency-based bonus amounts ($10/$20)
  - Compound threshold tracking ($50 target)
  - Action items ranked by severity
  - Revenue summary (daily fees, implied APR, cumulative fees)
  - Monday DCA reminder
- Frontend Impact Principle applies — feeds the DeFi Milestone Tracker data layer

**Frontend Impact Principle logged:
> *"As we add more layers, we're always going to consider how this is going to affect our front end, our DeFi milestone tracker."*

All future LP layer additions must pass a frontend compatibility check before deployment.
