# Gentech Task Board

## 📄 Communication Protocol

**HQ = Default conversation space.** All general chat, alerts, and cross-team coordination happens here.

**Specialized groups = Work only.** Labs, Entertainment, Strategies groups are for focused workstreams. No general chat in those groups.

**Smart Routing:**
- Route work to specialized groups when it requires focused execution
- Keep alerts, quick questions, and coordination in HQ
- Green Room = war room during active work sessions
- Mess Hall = status updates and stopping points

**Enforcement:** Cron job `d31c330959de` (Handoff Enforcement Monitor) runs every 15 min. ACK deadline: 5 min. Escalation: 15 min. Stalled: 24h. Agents must check green room before responding — no exceptions.

## Markers
- **[P]** Priority — active sprint, deadline approaching
- **[X]** Discard — skipped or dropped
- **[Q]** Queue — valid but no deadline, waiting for trigger

## Status
- ⏳ Pending | 🔄 In-Progress | ✅ Done | ❌ Cancelled
