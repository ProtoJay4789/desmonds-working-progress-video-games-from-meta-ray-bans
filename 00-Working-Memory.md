# GenTech Multi-Agent Workflow v1.1
Last Updated: 2026-05-05 (Daily Sync)

## Active Sprint — Week of May 4–11, 2026
- **Solana Frontier** — Day 5/8, deadline **May 11** (P0) — T-6 days
- **Kite AI** — Secondary priority, deadline **May 11** (P1) — corrected from May 17

## 🧘 System State — Incident Resolution (May 5 Status)

**May 4 incident summary:**
- D5 monitoring discrepancy — protocol defined, 3 follow-up tasks pending
- LFJ IL spike (-41.97%) — review flag triggered, range rebalanced to $9.44–$9.74
- Handoff ACK crisis — 2 handoffs escalated to Jordan (H2026-05-02-01, H2026-05-02-02)
- Nous OAuth revoked — DMOB manual intervention required

**May 5 morning state:**
- ✅ **LP position RESOLVED** — IL from -41.97% to -0.01% after range rebalance to $9.44–$9.74
- Position value $139.50, efficiency 64.7%, earning fees ($0.22/day)
- Portfolio website updated (header, projects section, filtering)
- Social content drafted for Solana Frontier launch (X + Facebook)
- All agents OFFLINE as of May 5 16:00 UTC

**Outstanding critical items (unresolved):**
1. **D5 Monitoring Discrepancy** — DMOB to symlink state files across HERMES profiles
2. **Milestone Ladder Reconciliation** — conflicting `$5/$20/$55/$200` vs `$3/$5/$8/$10` hardcodes
3. **6 Handoffs Overdue 8+ days** — H001–H004 + H2026-05-02-01/02
4. **Swarms Adapter Paused** — v0.1.0 built, 9 gaps identified, decision pending (resume or park)
5. **Agent Availability** — All 3 agents OFFLINE since Apr 27, T-6 to deadline

## Pending Handoffs (6 Identified)
- **H2026-05-02-01** — DMOB → YoYo (D5 milestone state machine, ACK due May 3) → **ESCALATED**
- **H2026-05-02-02** — YoYo → DMOB (D5 strategy params, ACK due May 3) → **ESCALATED**
- **H2026-05-02-03** — DMOB → Jordan (Gas Reserve SC review, overdue since Apr 21) → **STALLED**
- **H2026-05-02-04** — YoYo → Jordan (Gas Reserve strategy review, overdue since Apr 21) → **STALLED**
- **H001** — Desmond → Dmob (Dynamic Burn Rate SC feasibility, overdue since Apr 19)
- **H002** — Desmond → YoYo (Dynamic Burn Rate competitive analysis, overdue since Apr 19)

## DMOB Capacity Alert
4 P0/P1 parallel tracks: Solana Frontier build, Kite AI scoping, Dynamic Burn Rate SC review, Gas Reserve SC review. Last active Apr 27. No bandwidth buffer; high stall risk if not re-prioritized.

## Deadlines This Week
- **May 8** — Code complete for Solana Frontier
- **May 11** — **Solana Frontier submission + Kite AI Phase 1 demo** (BOTH due)
- **May 17** — Kite AI final submission

## Solana Frontier Status (Day 5/8, May 5)
**Target:** May 11 (6 days) | **Build Status:** PAUSED (since Apr 27)
**Deliverables remaining:** Anchor workspace scaffold (4 programs), AgentRegistry (World ID CPI), JobEscrow (PDAs), Reputation (Metaplex NFT), DisputeResolver (evidence-based), full test suite, devnet deployment, demo app (Next.js + Phantom + Swig + World ID).
**Blocker:** No active development since Swarms adapter pause; bandwidth likely allocated to portfolio work.

## LP Position Monitoring — AVAX/USDC (LFJ)
 **May 6 snapshot:** $123.74, IL adjusted, efficiency varies, range $9.44–$9.74 (Bid-Ask shape)
 **Range rebalanced** from $9.25–$9.59 to $9.44–$9.74 — Bid-Ask shape for volatility
- **Current status:** No rebalance needed; earning fees (~$0.22/day)
- **Pool volume:** $12.7M/day (healthy liquidity)

## D5 Milestone Tracker Status
- **Position variance issue:** Hardcoded `$5/$20/$55/$200` in `d5-master-cron.py` vs config `$3/$5/$8/$10/...` in AAE
- **Reconciliation pending:** DMOB state file symlink task + YoYo ladder alignment
- **Ground truth:** `lp-position-reader.py` → use Balance fields; `d5-master-cron.py` → watchlist only; `d5-milestone-summary.py` → narrative only

## Content Pipeline (May 5)
- **Solana Frontier social posts:** 2 versions drafted (X thread + Facebook), awaiting Jordan approval
- **Posting window:** May 8-9 (2-3 days before deadline)
- **Media needed:** Architecture diagram or anchor build screenshot

## Hackathon Landscape (May 5)
**Primary:** Kite AI + Solana Frontier (both May 11)
**Qualified but inactive:** IGNITION (Global Solana $5.12M), K2 ($135k USDC, Stellar), Agents Assemble ($32.5k, AI Healthcare)
**Strategy:** Stay focused on primary targets; secondary contests parked until post-May 11

## State & Resolution Notes
- Hermes profiles state architecture: consolidation pending (symlink `.lfj-*.json` to single source)
- Obsidian CLI `ob` unavailable — manual vault sync required for D5 updates
- ElevenLabs Voice Catalog integrated May 2 — all 4 agents assigned custom male voices
- Portfolio v2 deployed May 4 — mobile responsive, 7 projects, roadmap narrative, team grid
- Portfolio updated May 5 — new header, projects section, filtering, project rename

## Protocol Reference
- **Ground truth hierarchy:** 
  1. `lp-position-reader.py` (on-chain decoded) → USE for vault Balance fields
  2. `d5-master-cron.py` → USE for watchlist prices and pool volume metrics
  3. `d5-milestone-summary.py` → USE ONLY for narrative boilerplate/template
- **Variance rule:** >$0.50 balance variance or >5pp efficiency delta → log in Green Room, defer vault update

### LP Position Recovery (Key Win)
- May 4: IL crisis (-41.97%), efficiency degraded, review flagged
 **May 6: Range rebalanced to $9.44–$9.74, Bid-Ask shape, taking profits for Xiaomi Pro sub**
- Position earning fees again ($0.22/day), healthy and aligned with Scout tier

### Flags & Blockers
