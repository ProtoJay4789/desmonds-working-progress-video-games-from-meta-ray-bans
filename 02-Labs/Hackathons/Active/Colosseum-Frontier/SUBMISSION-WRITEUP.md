# AgentEscrow — Colosseum Solana Frontier Submission

## Project Name
**AgentEscrow**

## Tagline
Trust infrastructure for the agent economy.

## One-Liner
Agents are already transacting. There's no trust layer. AgentEscrow provides identity, reputation, and programmable escrow so agents can negotiate, pay, and settle jobs trustlessly on Solana.

---

## The Problem

AI agents are getting better at doing work every day. They write code, analyze data, manage portfolios, and negotiate with each other. But there's a fundamental missing piece: **trust**.

Today, agent-to-agent commerce looks like this:
- Agent A promises to deliver a service
- Agent B sends payment
- Agent A disappears

There's no escrow. No reputation. No identity verification. No dispute resolution. The agent economy is running on handshake deals in a trustless environment.

Current protocols solve fragments:
- **MCPay** — payment middleware (no escrow, no disputes)
- **Latinum** — payment routing (no identity, no reputation)
- **Corbits.dev** — Stripe for agents (no agent-to-agent, no trust layer)

**Nobody has built the trust layer.**

## The Solution

AgentEscrow is a full-stack agent economy infrastructure on Solana, built on top of **OOBE Protocol's identity layer**:

### Layer 1: Identity (OOBE Protocol)
OOBE's AgentIdentity plugin creates portable on-chain identities via Metaplex Core assets — one transaction, fully synced. Agents registered through OOBE are discoverable on SAP Explorer. We don't rebuild identity; we build on top of it.

### Layer 2: Reputation (AAE)
Ratings + Metaplex soulbound NFTs. Non-transferable reputation tokens that follow agents across the ecosystem. Tiered system (Scout → Rookie → Pro → Legend) that unlocks capabilities as agents prove themselves.

### Layer 3: Escrow (AAE)
PDA-locked funds with an 8-state lifecycle. Jobs flow from Open → Accepted → Submitted → Approved/Disputed → Completed. Auto-refund on deadline expiry. No one can rug — funds are locked in program-owned accounts.

### Layer 4: Disputes (AAE)
Evidence-based dispute handling. Both parties submit evidence, the resolver evaluates, and funds are distributed accordingly. AI-assisted resolution for complex cases.

## Sponsor Integrations

| Sponsor | Integration | Depth |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **OOBE Protocol** | AgentIdentity plugin on Metaplex Core assets + SAP Explorer discovery | High |
| **Phantom** | Wallet for human users — post jobs, fund escrow, approve work | Medium |
| **Swig** | Programmable agent wallets — autonomous signing, multi-token support, payment routing | High |
| **Metaplex** | Soulbound reputation NFTs — non-transferable, updatable, portable across protocols | High |
| **World** | Identity verification — Sybil resistance, nullifier-based, privacy-preserving | Medium |

**OOBE Protocol Integration:**
OOBE provides the identity + discovery layer via SAP v2 (Solana Agent Protocol). SAP's Identity Layer registers agents with on-chain profiles — name, capabilities, pricing tiers, reputation score. Agents registered via SAP are discoverable on SAP Explorer. AAE builds on top: marketplace, reputation, escrow. SAP handles identity + x402 micropayments; AAE handles hiring + tiered reputation + enforcement. The SAP program (`SAPpUhsWLJG1FfkGRcXagEDMrMsWGjbky7AyhGpFETZ`) is deployed to devnet with 72 instructions, 22 account types, and 45 events.

This is composability, not competition. OOBE handles the hard identity problem. We handle the hard trust problem. Together: full-stack agent economy infrastructure.

All sponsors are deeply woven into the stack. Not checkbox integrations — each solves a real problem in the agent economy.

## Technical Architecture

**4 Solana programs** built with Anchor + Rust:

```
AgentRegistry → register_agent / update_agent / deactivate_agent / link_metaplex_identity
JobEscrow     → post_job → accept → submit → approve/dispute
Reputation    → rate_agent / get_reputation / soulbound NFT mint
DisputeResolver → dispute_job → resolve (AI-assisted + manual)
```

**Key technical decisions:**
- PDA-based account model (no reentrancy risk)
- SPL Token for escrow vaults (native USDC support)
- Metaplex Core for lightweight NFT minting (~$0.000005/mint)
- **OOBE AgentIdentity plugin (MIP-014)** for portable agent identity
- World ID CPI for on-chain verification
- x402 standard for agent-to-agent micropayments
- 8-state job lifecycle with auto-refund on timeout

**Devnet deployment:** `4kX9b9hytCTrC6qikjVpnWYrvDK7NG97qCUDUTk9fMmn`

## What Makes This Different

### The Full Stack
Competitors build one piece. We build the infrastructure:
- Identity (OOBE + World ID + Metaplex) ✓
- Escrow (PDA-locked, auto-refund) ✓
- Reputation (soulbound NFTs, tiered) ✓
- Payments (Swig + x402) ✓
- Disputes (AI-assisted resolution) ✓

### SAP v2 Integration
OOBE provides the identity + discovery layer via SAP v2 (Solana Agent Protocol). SAP's Identity Layer registers agents with on-chain profiles — name, capabilities, pricing tiers, reputation score. Agents registered through SAP are discoverable on SAP Explorer. AAE builds on top: marketplace, reputation, escrow. The full lifecycle: **Identity (SAP) → Work (AAE) → Reputation (portable) → Token launch (OOBE).** We don't compete with OOBE — we compose with them.

### Portable Reputation
Reputation NFTs aren't just numbers — they're soulbound tokens that any protocol can read. An agent's reputation follows them across the entire Solana ecosystem. Build trust once, use it everywhere.

### Agent-Native Wallets
Swig gives agents programmable wallets with built-in guardrails. Agents can sign transactions autonomously without human intervention. Spend limits, recipient whitelists, and time locks keep agents honest.

### Sybil Resistance
World ID verification ensures one human = one verified agent base. No fake reputation farming. No Sybil attacks on the trust layer.

## Demo

5-minute live demo showing the full agent economy lifecycle:

1. **SAP Identity** — Agent registers via SAP v2 Identity Layer (AgentAccount PDA created)
2. **SAP Explorer** — Agent appears on OOBE's discovery layer
3. **AAE Registration** — Agent links SAP identity to AAE AgentRegistry
4. **Job Posting** — Human posts job via Phantom wallet, funds escrow
5. **Agent Acceptance** — Agent accepts via Swig programmable wallet
6. **Work & Approval** — Work submitted, human approves, funds released
7. **Reputation Update** — Soulbound NFT updated, tier progression shown
8. **Dispute Flow** — Evidence-based dispute resolution demonstrated
9. **Agent-to-Agent** — x402 micropayment between two agents

All transactions live on Solana devnet, verifiable on Solana Explorer.
