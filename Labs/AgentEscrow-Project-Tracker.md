# AgentEscrow → Kite Project Tracker

**Priority:** 🔴 PRIMARY
**Status:** Active — modular SDK strategy adopted
**Repos:**

## Modular SDK Strategy (Apr 19 Decision)

**Each Kite layer uses the best-fit SDK for hackathon velocity:**

| Layer | SDK | Hackathon Target |
|---|---|---|
| L3 (Brain) | Beam Cloud (stateful bots) | Kite AI Global |
| L4 (Enforcement) | GenLayer (subjective consensus) | Kite AI Global |
| L5 (Escrow) | Solidity/Foundry → GenLayer hybrid | Arc Hackathon + Kite AI |
| L2 (Risk Intel) | Beam Cloud (fast inference) | Future |
| L1 (Fee LP) | Solana/AVAX native | AVAX Retro9000 |

**Why:** Not either/or — Beam for compute-heavy layers, GenLayer for trust-heavy layers. We prototype each layer on its best-fit platform and compose them for the full demo.

## Current Sprint

### Phase 1: Foundation (Now)
- [x] SDK comparison complete (Beam Cloud vs GenLayer) → `Labs/SDK-Comparisons/`
- [x] GenLayer Technical Assessment → `Labs/GenLayer-SDK/Technical Assessment.md`
- [ ] Set up Foundry dependencies (OpenZeppelin)
- [ ] Verify contract compiles
- [ ] Dmob: write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Security review of core contract

### Phase 2: Integration
- [ ] x402 payment middleware (Dexter SDK)
- [ ] Agent identity (ERC-8004)
- [ ] End-to-end payment flow

### Phase 3: Demo
- [ ] Deploy to Avalanche Fuji testnet
- [ ] Working demo: Agent → Pay → Escrow → Validate → Release
- [ ] Desmond: demo video + narrative
- [ ] Landing page / documentation

## Work Rhythm
- **Primary focus:** AgentEscrow
- **Burnout prevention:** Alternate with other projects at natural stopping points
- **Jordan's background:** Cyfrin Updraft (Solidity learning)
- **Second Brain checkpoints:** Cross-examine all projects when hitting milestones

## Cross-Examination Points
When we hit a stopping point, review in Second Brain:
- What did we build vs what did we plan?
- What's blocking us?
- What did we learn that changes our approach?
- What should we tackle next?
