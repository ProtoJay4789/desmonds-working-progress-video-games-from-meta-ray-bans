# hermes-kanban — Execution Document

**Project:** Hermes Kanban Bridge
**Repo:** https://github.com/GumbyEnder/hermes-kanban
**Working Dir:** /mnt/nas/agents/projets/hermes-kanban
**Obsidian Design Ref:** /mnt/nas/Obsidian Vault/hermes-kanban/Hermes-Kanban Bridge.md
**PM:** Frodo (Hermes)
**Owner:** GumbyEnder
**Started:** 2026-04-22
**Status:** ACTIVE — Phase 1 in progress

---

## Vision

Turn Hermes into a true project co-pilot that lives inside your Obsidian workspace.
The result: Hermes can break any goal into a Kanban board, move cards, query state,
and run planning rituals — all from inside Obsidian, fully local, fully private.

---

## Expanded Scope (beyond original spec)

The original plan covered plugin + 2 skills. This execution expands to:

1. Plugin with full REST API (localhost:27124, configurable)
2. 3 Hermes skills (orchestrator, project-breakdown, rituals)
3. CI/CD via GitHub Actions (build + test on push)
4. Automated install script for plugin + skills
5. Obsidian Kanban plugin compatibility (mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban)
6. Optional: MCP adapter so plugin can also serve as an MCP server
7. Developer docs (README, API reference, SKILLS reference)
8. A live demo board in the repo (docs/demo/)

---

## Architecture

```
Hermes Agent
    |
    | HTTP (localhost:27124)
    v
hermes-kanban-bridge plugin (Obsidian)
    |
    | Vault API (obsidian.app.vault)
    v
Obsidian Vault / Markdown Kanban files
    (compatible with mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban plugin)
```

Plugin runs an embedded HTTP server.
All write operations require user confirmation modal (configurable to auto-trust).
Hermes skills call the REST endpoints; fall back to direct Markdown writes if plugin is offline.

## REST API Reference (target spec)

Base URL: `http://localhost:27124` (configurable)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /health | Plugin liveness check |
| GET | /boards | List all boards |
| POST | /boards | Create new board |
| GET | /boards/:id | Get board state |

## Risks & Blockers

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Obsidian API for HTTP server may be restricted | HIGH | Use Node http module bundled with plugin; test early |
| mgmeyers Kanban format is undocumented | MEDIUM | Parse from existing board files; write tests |
| Hermes skill auto-load timing | LOW | Skills already work in Markdown fallback today |
| Port conflicts on 27124 | LOW | Make port configurable in settings |

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-04-22 | Expand scope to include CI/CD, install script, MCP stretch | Gumby gave full execution authority |
| 2026-04-22 | Use /mnt/nas/agents/projets/hermes-kanban as working dir | NAS preferred for project outputs |
| 2026-04-22 | kanban-orchestrator.md skill exists as draft — reuse + update | Avoid duplicate work |
| 2026-04-22 | Bundle obsidian-kanban (mgmeyers) in install script instead of forking | Less maintenance, respects MIT license |
| 2026-04-22 | Bind server to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1 | Hermes runs on a different machine; Tailscale access required |
| 2026-04-22 | Add kanban-plugin: board frontmatter to all created boards | Required by obsidian-kanban to render visual board |

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Phase 4 — Integration Testing** (only remaining phase):
   - Gumby installs plugin in Obsidian (copy plugin/main.js + manifest.json to vault .obsidian/plugins/hermes-kanban-bridge/)
   - Enable plugin in Obsidian settings
   - Verify `GET http://localhost:27124/health` returns ok
   - Ask Hermes to break down a goal into a board (triggers kanban-orchestrator skill)
   - Run daily standup ritual
   - Test card move + blocked query
   - Test fallback: stop plugin, verify Markdown fallback works

2. **Stretch Goal 6.1** (optional): MCP adapter for the plugin
