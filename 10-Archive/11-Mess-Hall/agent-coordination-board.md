# Agent Coordination Board

## MANDATORY — Read at session start before any other action

This is the Gentech org coordination board. Every agent MUST check this file at the start of each session.

## Org Structure

```
                    [CEO] Jordan — Vision, final decisions, HQ
                              |
                    [COO] Gentech — PM, coordination, enforcement
                   ┌──────────┼──────────┐
            [CTO] Dmob    [CRO] YoYo    [CMO] Desmond
            Labs          Strategies    Entertainment
```

## Department Rules

- **HQ (Jordan, Gentech):** Dispatch, decisions, coordination, ops
- **Labs (Dmob):** Smart contracts, Foundry, security, deployment, hackathons
- **Strategies (YoYo):** Research, DeFi analysis, competitive landscape, market data
- **Entertainment (Desmond):** Content, X posts, Medium, social media, submissions

## Load Balancing Protocol

DMOB is single point of failure for all code work. To prevent overload:
- **Max 2 P1 tasks** assigned to DMOB at any time
- **YoYo picks up** SDK research, API integration, and non-contract code tasks
- **Desmond handles** all submission packaging, README, demo materials
- **Gentech triages** incoming work before assigning — no direct DMOB drops from Jordan
- If DMOB has 3+ active tasks → Gentech redistributes or defers lowest priority

### Status Legend
- `PENDING` — Handoff written, waiting for recipient to claim
- `CLAIMED` — Recipient acknowledged, actively working
- `COMPLETED` — Work done, delivered to Jordan
- `ESCALATED` — Unclaimed past deadline, Gentech notified Jordan

### Active Handoffs

| ID | From | To | Task | Priority | Status | Notes |
|----|------|----|------|----------|--------|-------|
| — | — | — | No active handoffs | — | — | Board clean as of May 10 |

### Protocol
1. **Sender** writes handoff here + tags recipient in Mess Hall or Green Room
2. **Recipient** MUST update status to CLAIMED within 2 hours of being tagged
3. **Recipient** completes work → updates to COMPLETED + delivers result
4. **Unclaimed >4h** → Gentech nudges recipient
5. **Unclaimed >12h** → Gentech escalates to Jordan
