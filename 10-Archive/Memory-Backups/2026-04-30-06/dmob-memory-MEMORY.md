Green Room (09-Green Room/) = inter-agent coordination during active work/tasks. Mess Hall (11-Mess Hall/) = social chat and general discussion outside of work. These are distinct channels with different purposes.

Colosseum Copilot: `~/.hermes/scripts/colosseum-config.json` (ProtoJay4789, id:98610). Frontier: 12d, $230K+. Brother's wedding May 23. Private screenshots stay HQ-only.
§
Travel folder convention: `00-HQ/Travel/` in gentech vault. Each country gets its own folder (e.g., `00-HQ/Travel/Philippines/`). When planning a new trip, create country folder if it doesn't exist, add trip doc + flights.md. Consolidate duplicates — keep one main trip doc per trip.
§
AAE monitor loads runtime config from `.lfj-aae-config.json` (in `~/.hermes/scripts/`), not just from the hardcoded DEFAULT_CONFIG in the Python script. To update position balance, must edit BOTH the vault Python script AND the runtime JSON config file. The JSON config is what the script actually reads.

Workflow: When Jordan sends screenshots/images in HQ that contain sensitive info (emails, docs, etc.), DMOB should redact PII/account details and produce a clean text summary for sharing in other channels (Labs, Mess Hall, etc.). Raw images with sensitive content stay in HQ only.
