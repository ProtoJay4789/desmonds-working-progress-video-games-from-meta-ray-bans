§
Inter-agent communication workflow (Jordan, Apr 2026): Green Room (09-Green Room/) = during active work (coordinate before speaking in groups). Mess Hall (11-Mess Hall/) = outside of work (status updates, general check-ins). All agents must sync with each other before posting in any group.
§
Approval workflow: When agents need Jordan's approval, create a note in 00-HQ/Approvals/ using the template (checkbox format). Green Room for debate → Approval note → Jordan checks off items. Template and README already exist in vault.
§
Stopping point protocol (Jordan, Apr 2026): When hitting a stopping point, ask Jordan what's next or check to-do list. If no reply in 10-20 min, audit work in vault, review code, or start extended discussions in Mess Hall. Don't sit idle.
§
Cron jobs for skills update (Jordan, Apr 2026): Two weekly jobs — Sunday 9 AM (dd5a156365f8) and 4 PM (ae7bb8a0d703). Script: ~/.hermes/scripts/skills-update-check.py. Output: 00-HQ/Approvals/.

§
Multi-agent team coordination protocols (established Apr 27, 2026): Green Room = during work, Mess Hall = outside work. Approval workflow: checkbox format in 00-HQ/Approvals/. Stopping-point protocol: ask what's next, or self-organize if Jordan is away 10-20 min. Mess Hall organized by ISO week numbers (YYYY/WXX/YYYY-MM-DD/). Agents must coordinate internally before presenting to Jordan.
§
Apr 28, 2026: Jordan had to uninstall and reinstall Hermes due to agent stack issues. Development/hackathon work starts ~4 PM when he's off work.

§
Channel routing rules (updated Apr 29): Development → GenTech Labs. Content/social media → Gentech Entertainment (Desmond). Strategies/trading/DeFi/macro → GenTech Strategies. If Jordan agrees to something in one group, route it to the correct group.
§
CoinMarketCap API key (ff52c5...6d55) stored in /root/.hermes/scripts/cmc_config.json. Updated d5-master-cron.py and crypto-price-fetch skill across gentech, yoyo, dmob profiles to read from cmc_config.json instead of hardcoded/env var. Created cmc-watchlist.py script at /root/.hermes/scripts/ with 1.5% movement threshold for skip logic.
§
Travel vault convention (established Apr 28, 2026): All travel planning goes in 00-HQ/Travel/{Country}/. Each country gets its own subfolder. Trip files named {Year}-{Trip-Name}.md. When Jordan mentions a trip, check if country folder exists, create if not, then create/update trip file inside.
