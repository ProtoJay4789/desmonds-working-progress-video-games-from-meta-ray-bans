Inter-agent communication workflow (Jordan, Apr 2026): Green Room (09-Green Room/) = during active work (coordinate before speaking in groups). Mess Hall (11-Mess Hall/) = outside of work (status updates, general check-ins). All agents must sync with each other before posting in any group.
§
Approval workflow: When agents need Jordan's approval, create a note in 00-HQ/Approvals/ using the template (checkbox format). Green Room for debate → Approval note → Jordan checks off items. Template and README already exist in vault.
§
Stopping point protocol (Jordan, May 2026): When hitting a stopping point (waiting on approval, blocked by agent availability, missing tools), queue up the next task and start working on it. Don't wait for Jordan — keep momentum going. Stopping points: approval needed, agent unavailable (e.g., DMOB not available), missing tool/dependency. Pivot to next queued deliverable immediately.
