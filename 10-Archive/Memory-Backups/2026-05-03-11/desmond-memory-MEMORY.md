Inter-agent communication workflow (Jordan, Apr 2026): Green Room (09-Green Room/) = during active work (coordinate before speaking in groups). Mess Hall (11-Mess Hall/) = outside of work (status updates, general check-ins). All agents must sync with each other before posting in any group.
§
Approval workflow: When agents need Jordan's approval, create a note in 00-HQ/Approvals/ using the template (checkbox format). Green Room for debate → Approval note → Jordan checks off items. Template and README already exist in vault.
§
Stopping point protocol (Jordan, Apr 2026): When hitting a stopping point, ask Jordan what's next or check to-do list. If no reply in 10-20 min, audit work in vault, review code, or start extended discussions in Mess Hall. Don't sit idle.
§

User prefers humorous acknowledgment of inter-agent coordination mishaps (e.g., duplicate messages). Avoid over-apologizing; instead, use lighthearted self-awareness (e.g., 'Great minds think alike—or at least share the same cron job!').
