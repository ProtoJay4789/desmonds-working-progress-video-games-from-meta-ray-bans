# Kite AI Hackathon — Session Reference (May 2, 2026)

**Audited by:** DMOB (Labs)  
**Purpose:** Example of complete status audit showing discrepancy detection and blocker identification

## Official Sources
- **Hackathon page:** https://encode.club/hackathon/kite-ai (direct access blocked at session time)
- **Official deadline (vault record):** May 11, 2026
- **Extended deadline (found in active file):** May 17, 2026 ⚠️ DISCREPANCY DETECTED

## Our Submission Status

### Repository
- **Canonical repo:** https://github.com/ProtoJay4789/kite-agent-commerce
- **Branch:** main
- **Last commit:** 2026-04-25T03:50:29Z (Option A Fast Port prep)
- **Tests:** 58/58 passing ✅
- **Status:** CODE READY — NOT SUBMITTED

### What's Built
- AgentEscrow.sol (238 lines, production-ready, reentrancy/CEI fixed)
- TECHPaymentRouter.sol (161 lines)
- MockTECH.sol (testnet token)
- Deploy.s.sol (Kite testnet, Chain ID 2368)
- Minimal UI (ui/index.html, ethers.js)
- Security audit: 4/5 (DMOB), all medium findings fixed

### Blockers
1. **GAS BLOCKED** — Deployer wallet `0xE00a46132Fd03456cEcd05de8C69F43C5138Db95` has 0 KITE
   - Faucet: https://faucet.gokite.ai/ (manual reCAPTCHA)
2. **NOT DEPLOYED** — No verified contracts on Kite testnet explorer
3. **NOT SUBMITTED** — No submission marker in vault, no PR opened, no email confirmation
4. **Demo video** — not recorded (task assigned to DMOB)
5. **Kite attestation** — research incomplete (does Kite have native attestation contract?)

## Handoff Context
- **Desmond → DMOB handoff:** Apr 24 — identified Option A vs Option B decision
- **YoYo → DMOB handoff:** Apr 25 — Jordan selected Option A, deployment ready except gas
- **Consolidation handoff:** Apr 25 — agent-escrow selected as canonical base, kite-agent-commerce to merge/discard
- **Most recent status:** Gentech-HQ.md shows "Kite AI — EVM repo deploy" as queued, due May 17

## Decision Record
- **Option A (Fast Port)** selected by Jordan (reverted from Option B Novel Track)
- Rationale: Stronger submission, hits all requirements, but high risk in 24h
- Current path: Deploy to Kite testnet + minimal UI + demo video

## Required to Complete submission
1. DMOB: Fund wallet via Kite faucet
2. DMOB: Broadcast `forge script scripts/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $KITE_RPC_URL --broadcast`
3. DMOB: Verify contracts on https://testnet.kitescan.ai/
4. DMOB: Record 5-minute demo video showing full flow
5. Desmond: Finalize README with Kite integration roadmap
6. DMOB/Desmond: Confirm submission actually made to Encode Club

## Team Context
- DMOB overloaded: 4+ P1 tasks (Solana Frontier PRIMARY, Kite AI PRIMARY, DisputeResolver handoff)
- Solana Frontier due May 11 (9 days), Kite AI due May 17 (15 days)
- 4 handoffs unclaimed for 13+ days (H001–H004: dynamic burn rate + gas reserve auto-rebalance)

## Notes for Future Audits
- Always check GitHub commit dates — last Kite commit was Apr 25, no movement since
- Vault can show "active" but work may be stalled
- Deadline discrepancies common — always cross-check official source if accessible
- Wallet address and faucet URL are concrete, verifiable items; if wallet empty = deployment not done
- "Tests passing" ≠ "submitted" — separate verification layer needed
