## 2026-05-14 Update (20:17 UTC)
**AVAX Price**: $9.9970 (+2.50% 24h)
**USDC Price**: $0.9996 (-0.01% 24h)
**Price Range**: $9.45–$10.00 (Shape: Curve)
**Target**: $9.45–$10.00
**Balances**: 10.43 AVAX (~$104.25) + 92.67 USDC (~$92.63) = **$196.88**
**Wallet**: 0.0983 AVAX (~$0.98) + 0.00 USDC (~$0.00) = **$0.98** | **Combined Total**: **$197.86**
**Fees (24h)**: ~$0.46 (est. from $12.5M vol × 5bps × 0.005% pool share × 1.5x CL boost; oracle not configured)
**IL**: -0.9% ✓ below 2% threshold
**Efficiency**: 6.9% (on-chain share of bin supply — price at 96.5% of range limits Curve effectiveness)
**Action**: ⚠️ Review — price rallied +2.50% to $10.00, pushing active bin to 96.5% of range top. Position balanced 53/47 but near upper boundary. If price breaks above $10.00, position goes out-of-range. Consider widening upper range or monitoring for breakout.

**D5 Milestone Alignment**:
- Scout tier ($5.00/day target) — est. daily fees $0.46 → 9.2% progress
- Price inside strategic target band ✅ ($10.00 within $9.45–$10.00)
- IL -0.9% ✓ below 2% threshold
- Efficiency 6.9% <50% → Micro-DCA boost triggered

**Other Pools**: No additional LFJ pools (AVAX/JOE, USDC/JOE, etc.) detected with active positions for this wallet.

**Note**: Price rallied +2.50% in 24h (flagged >1.5%). AVAX moved from ~$9.75 → $10.00, pushing active bin from 8363235 → 8363264 (now 96.5% of range). Efficiency dropped from 85.9% → 6.9% — the on-chain reader returns raw bin supply share (ground truth), while previous vault entries used a shape-adjusted formula. Position is earning but competing with significant liquidity in same bins. IL shifted +0.3% → -0.9% (1.2pp swing) as price rose through range. Pool TVL $4.03M, volume $12.5M/24h. Position rebalanced May 13 from $9.95–$10.30.

**Efficiency**: 89.4% ✓ ≥50% — excellent concentration
**Action**: ✅ No rebalance needed — price centered in curve range. Position rebalanced from $9.95–$10.30 (out-of-range) to $9.45–$10.00 (in-range). Efficiency recovered from -10.7% to 89.4%.

**Wallet**: 0.0972 AVAX (~$0.96) + 0.00 USDC (~$0.00) = **$0.96** | **Combined Total**: **$204.04**
**Fees (24h)**: ~$0.02 (est. from $9.52M vol × 5bps × 0.0049% pool share × 0.1x CL out-of-range; oracle not configured)
**IL**: ~0.0% (vs. HODL of ~$204) ✓ below 2% threshold
**Efficiency**: -10.7% (100% AVAX — fully out of range below)
**Action**: 🚨 CRITICAL: Rebalance required — price ($9.9157) below range lower bound ($9.95). Position converted to 100% AVAX. Efficiency -10.7%. Active bin (8363260) is 2 bins below position start (8363262).

**D5 Milestone Alignment**:
- Scout tier ($5.00/day target) — est. daily fees ~$0.02 → 0.4% progress
- Price OUTSIDE strategic target band ($9.95–$10.30) — below lower bound
- IL ~0.0% ✓ below 2% threshold
- Efficiency -10.7% <50% → Micro-DCA boost triggered

**Other Pools**: No additional LFJ pools (AVAX/JOE, USDC/JOE, etc.) detected with active positions for this wallet.

**Note**: Position range appears to have shifted to $9.95–$10.30 (on-chain bins 8363262–8363296) since last vault-logged rebalance on May 12 ($9.75–$10.01). Price at $9.9157 is below the new range lower bound. Position is 100% AVAX with zero USDC — classic out-of-range-below state. Rebalance needed to re-center range around current price.
## 2026-05-12 06:10 AM Rebalance (jordan_screenshot)
**Price Range**: $9.75–$10.01 (Shape: Curve)
**Balances**: 9.771 AVAX (~$96.61) + 106.59 USDC (~$106.57) = **$203.18**
**Fees (24h)**: ~$1.344 (0.07251 AVAX + 0.62683 USDC)
**IL**: ~0.0% (freshly rebalanced) ✓ below 2% threshold
**Range Status**: 🟢 In Range — price ~$9.89, centered in distribution
**Last Rebalance**: 2026-05-12 06:10 AM (jordan_screenshot)
**Action**: No rebalance needed — price centered in new curve range.
**Position Note**: Rebalanced from Bid-Ask ($9.68–$10.00) to Curve ($9.75–$10.01). Jordan analysis: "Bid-ask was great for the fall but most of the day was spent in the middle of bid ask. Low efficiency is a no go." Curve shape better for ranging markets — earns more when price stays centered. Position value stable at $203.18.

**D5 Milestone Alignment**:
- Scout tier ($5.00/day target) — est. daily fees ~$1.34 → 26.8% progress
- Price inside position range ✅
- IL ✓ well below 2% threshold
- Curve shape = optimal for ranging market at $9.89

**Position Note**: DCA rebalance — shifted from Curve ($9.81–$10.06) to Bid-Ask ($9.68–$10.00). Bid-Ask shape concentrates more liquidity near current price for higher fee capture in ranging markets. Range widened slightly on bottom ($0.13 down) and tightened on top ($0.06 down). Position value stable at $201.94.

**D5 Milestone Alignment**:
- Scout tier ($5.00/day target) — est. daily fees ~$1.88 → 37.6% progress
- Price inside position range ✅
- IL ✓ well below 2% threshold
