## 🤖 Agents — Smart Routing v2

[Full Protocol →](00-System/agents-protocol.md)

| Agent | Group | Domain | Writes To |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Gentech** | HQ (`-1003863540828`) | Coordinator — receives all, routes | `00-Sessions` |
| **YoYo** | Strategies (`-1002916759037`) | DeFi, market research, LP tracking | `03-Strategies` |
| **DMOB** | Labs (`-1003872552815`) | Smart contracts, security, code, hackathons | `02-Labs` |
| **Desmond** | Creative (`-1003893562036`) | Content, branding, social media | `04-Entertainment`, `06-Content` |

### How We Work
- **Gentech receives → routes to specialist group → agent works → summary to HQ**
- **Green Room** → Active task collaboration (`09-Green Room/`)
- **Mess Hall** → Off-topic, banter (`11-Mess Hall/`)
- **Before replying** → Check Green Room + Mess Hall for context
- **Vault sync** → Git-based; Obsidian sync disabled to prevent conflicts

## 🔒 Consolidation Rules

1. **Single-file folders** → Move file to parent MOC; delete empty shell
2. **Merge artifacts** (`_*`) → Archive to `10-Archive/` with provenance
3. **Cross-domain duplicates** → Route to canonical agent owner:
   - Code/UI → `02-Labs/`
   - Content scripts → `04-Entertainment/`
   - Analytics → `03-Strategies/`
4. **Real repos** (Foundry, Anchor) → Stay in `03-Projects/` or code root
5. **Index** → This file updated on every consolidation pass
